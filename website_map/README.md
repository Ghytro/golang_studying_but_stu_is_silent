# website_map

This is a tool that allows to show a link map for a website. This map is a graph that repsresents which pages can be visited from certain pages.

The output of this tool can be redirected to file and then compiled by graphviz compiler.

For now the output is not so pretty, cause of the long names of the links, but I'm working on it. Maybe, graphviz was not the best choice.
